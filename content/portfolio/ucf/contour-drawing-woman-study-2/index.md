A second study of a female done in UCF contour. THis actually came before the first study I posted.

In a lot of these I cant help but feel I shied away from hard questions such as the face. However unlike a previous post, I did connect the questions relating to the background to the figure.

For anyone unfamiliar; Ucf style contour is Blind and Semi-blind contour focused on extreme concentration of desired information (in this case forms) tied together with intercross and done with with certain material usage. The focus is on questions, what order they are asked, how they are answered and how the answers are written. The goal, as with any form of stern observation, is to break down preconceived notions. I'll be making a blog post over the next few days describing Base UCF contour and how I use it
