## Hello!

I'm R. Levi Siewert, 

I'd consider myself to be a lot of things but to list in short I'm a technical artist, traditional artist and hiking enthusiast! I'm often found at coffee shops working on personal projects! This blog is meant to be a public itinerary of my adventures.



## Technical Interests:
- Blender animation & game pipeline design (Design, Operation, Maintenance) 
- Hard surface modeling (often digital twins)
- Standalone tooling, including software
- Environment & Asset scanning
- Custom Nodegraph design and parsing
- Blender & Godot


For any pipeline, the easy way should be the right way!



## Personal interests:
- Long distance Hiking (AT nobo '22!)
- Traditional sculpture


If you are interested in more info, a specific project or becoming a stakeholder in one of my open proposals please reach out!
